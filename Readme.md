# TDoC - IMPERIUM

## About the project

Imperium is an indigenous Version Control System(like git) written in C++, absolutely from scratch.
It is mostly a logical approach to filesystem manipulation to emulate the basic functionalities of git. This is a project I made during [Ten Days of Code](https://10-days-of-code.netlify.app/), organised by The GNU/Linux User's Group, NIT Durgapur([@lugnitdgp](https://github.com/lugnitdgp)). You can check their Repo [here.](https://github.com/lugnitdgp/TDoC-Imperium)

## How to Contribute

The repo will have a folder dedicated to each of the participants. You are required to clone the repo, edit the code in your folder and send pull requests. These will be the judging/completion criteria for the event.
